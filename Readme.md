# Hackathon
This website is  chat site which allows students to communicate with each other and with the teacher. It is an easy way to communicate with your teachers, and it can prompt an instant response as compared to email which takes a long time.
You can have multiple class chats for multiple classes, and you can ask questions about homework or projects. This is a feature that is not available in Google Classroom, so we decided to try to create it.
